<h2 class="heading-medium caps">Seller One interview
        </h2>

      <p>I visited a flower boutique in South London, speaking to their owner about their experience of using digital platforms to generate sales and engage with customers.</p>

 <p>The owner spoked of how her business had been on Trouva for the last two years but she recently started to make purchasing decisions from wholesalers with the specific intention of putting those items on Trouva. It was her intention that her online shop would eventually be as eclectic as her physical shop, other than the ability to sell actual flowers, which she explained was not possible as Trouva couldn’t handle the delivery of such items.</p>

 <p>She told me that despite Trouva’s attempts to promote repeat business, she did not know of any returning customers online. However she referred to the customers that visited her physical shop as ‘loyal’ and knew of many that visited every week, despite this it was with other businesses that the shop owner seemed to speak of any connection or community made through Trouva:</p>

 <p><i>“Trouva helps to connect businesses, it’s platform with a wide audience and it’s great to be part of that with other small businesses. I’ve met other businesses through Trouva events, we bounce ideas off each other. I can see a real bond between retailers through Trouva.”</i></p>

 <p>When I asked her about why she felt people chose to shop online or through physical stores, she told me that she felt there was a currently trend to shop locally, but that convenience was the most important thing for people – Trouva helped to meet the needs of people who wanted to stay within this trend but were unable to do this on a regular basis. She finished the interview by saying she felt that:</p>

 <p><i>“People that shop through Trouva don’t shop through physical stores.”</i></p>
