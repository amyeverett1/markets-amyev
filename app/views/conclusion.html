        </h2>

<p>The research aimed to understand the appeal of online markets that maintain traditional offline structures, focusing on the use of Trouva by customers and sellers.</p>

<p>Semi-structured interviews helped me to understand the processes that surround selling and buying in physical and digital spaces, and how these processes differ based on the location or platform used. The research also looked into the interaction between sellers and customers facilitated by Trouva through social media and Trouva’s own website.</p>


<p>My research with sellers revealed a stark difference between the relationship sellers had with customers in their physical shop and their online Trouva shop. Sellers spoke warmly of the customers that visit their physical shop, knowing and recognising them well enough to identify them as repeat customers who live in vicinity to the shop.</p>

<p>The relationship between sellers and online customers was very much a different experience. One seller spoke of how he actively encouraged customers to interact with Trouva as opposed to him, and both sellers told me of the importance of Trouva as a ‘middle man’ in the process. Neither seller was able to recall repeat custom from online customer, or any overlap in custom from those who might shop through their Trouva shop and also in their physical shop.</p>

<p>The communication offered from Trouva’s customer support team to customers was identified by both sellers as one of the key benefits of using Trouva to sell products. For sellers, the appeal of Trouva was the ability to sell products in an online space whilst still supporting the existence of their physical space. </p>

<p>My customer interview revealed the extent of the disconnection between Trouva sellers and customers. The participant spoke of how she chose to use Trouva because she wanted to support local businesses but who the local businesses were was of little importance to her - it was the act of supporting them as a collective group that led to her behaviour, as opposed to having any vested interest in the specifics of this.</p>

<p>In this sense, she felt as though she was able to retain the physical spaces in which she told me she enjoyed spending time, whilst still having the convenience of using Trouva to have items delivered to her home whenever she needed them.  Despite this motivating her use of Trouva, she was clear to point out that she did not make use of other similar websites such as notonthehighstreet.com due to the difference in quality of their products when compared to Trouva. Without Trouva’s specific style of products it is unclear if the appeal of supporting independent businesses would still have any value to the participant. Further research would need to be done with other customers to understand if retaining physical stores was really a key motivator in the use of Trouva, or if the style and quality of the products was ultimately the aim for customers, with any associated ethics a consequential benefit.</p>

<p>Trouva claims on their Values page on their website that:</p>
<p><i>“We are building connections between retailers and customers beyond the transaction. We are growing a community which connects independent boutiques with customers who love them. Being part of our community is a two-way relationship; the more you contribute the more you get back. Our vision is to be much more than a sales platform, we want to be the destination for like-minded boutiques and customers.”</i></p>

<p>This research could have been improved by further interviews conducted with sellers and customers. Such a small number of participants does not allow the research to claim any representative validity. I would state that this research has raised interesting points surrounding the relationship facilitated by Trouva and highlighted the high level motivations behind the use of physical and online stores by sellers and customers. </p>
